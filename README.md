# NeuralNetworkandDeepLearning
I have committed coursera deep learning specialization's first course assignment that is Neural network and Deep learning

It was the four week course where I learned creating neural network and made a cat/non-cat classifier.

# First week 
In this week learned basic concepts of deep learning, about supervised learning.

# Second week 
In this week I learned to create neural network with no hidden layer. 
I learned about Binary Classification, Logistic Regression, Gradient descent as well as how to avoid explicit for loop by the help of vectorization.
At last I created a cat/non-cat classifier using single layer perceptron.

# Third week 
In this week I learned about Neural Network representation, Parameters such as activation function, Backpropogation Intuition.
Intro to hyperparameter such as hidden layer. 
I used one hidden layer and repeat the cat/non-cat classifier, I saw this worked better than neural network with no hidden layer. It improved the accuracy.

# Fourth week
In this week I created deep neural network with more than one hidden layer.
The steps I followed to create deep neural network is:
           - Parameter Initialization
           - Forward propogation
           - Calculating cost.
           - Backward propogation
           - updating parameters
           - find cost
 This way I successfully create cat/non-cat classifier with L-layer model.
 I saw, I got more accuracy this time than shallow neural network.
